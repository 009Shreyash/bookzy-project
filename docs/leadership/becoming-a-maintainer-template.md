# Becoming a maintainer template

The following questions need to be answered to help set the expectations with both the owner & wider team, and the prospective maintainer.
As explained in the [team document](https://github.com/knjk04/book-project/blob/master/docs/TEAM.md), we appreciate people are flexible
and that becoming a maintainer is a big commitment. We want to be flexible to respect people's other commitments. If your 
availability changes, that's fine. The important thing is to let us know so that we are clear and can be respective of your time.

1. At the very minimum, how frequently are you able to contribute (e.g. once a week, once a month, etc.)?

2. What is the main area that you will be able to help with (e.g. Hibernate & JPA, Docker, etc.)?

3. At the minimum, how often are you able to help with reviewing pull requests (we aim to review all pull requests within at most seven days)?

4. Are you able to help fix failing builds or when we have high-priority bugs to fix on a regular basis (e.g. weekly)?

5. Are you able to help others and respond to others on Gitter (we aim to respond to messages within at most seven days)?
