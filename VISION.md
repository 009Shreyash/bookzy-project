This document explains at a high-level the direction in which we're pushing the project.

## What will the Book Project be?

We are building a hub for readers, authors and publishers. Fundamentally, we want to improve book discovery. It should be easy to find new books to read that match our users' interests. 
As a hub, we want our web app to be the single place that our users go to find the next great book and also to engage with authors, publishers and other readers.

## What we won't be

We're not another Goodreads or LibraryThing. We're rethinking what it means to be a book hub from the ground up and to provide a service that our users love. In other words, we're not 
producing a clone of an existing app. We're working on designing the best experience for anyone who loves books.

Some users may like the social network experience -- seeing what their 'real-life' friends are reading. But not all do. Social networks also have associations with privacy concerns. 

How are we different? For starters, we're not pushing the social network experience on anyone. We're making it opt-in, so, by default, you can just use it a service to discover and catalogue books.
When it comes to privacy, we're planning to be 1) totally transparent and 2) not collect more data than we need to. For more information, see our [core principles](https://github.com/Project-Books/book-project/wiki/Core-principles) page.
